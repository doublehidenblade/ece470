We used CoppeliaSim V4.0.0 EDU as our simulator.
We imported built-in robot model(ant hexapod) and sensor(passage counter).
You can just copy our "Current_code for simple movement" and paste it on the script of ant robot.
Ant robot will go straight without ant other movement after clicking "Start simulation" button.
